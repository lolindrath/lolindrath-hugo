# Currently Reading

* Circe - Madeline Miller - a retelling of the Odyssey, interesting so far.
* High Output Management - Andy Grove - good but it's taking me a while to get through it.

## Just Finished
* Washington: A Life - Ron Chernow - really briliant and complete biography. Washington was the right man at the right time, despite all his flaws.

(Been hitting Libby hard for Neil Gaiman - love these books. Murderbot Diaries series is also great)

## Soon
* 5 Dysfunctions of a Team
* Station Eleven


# Watching
* Brooklyn 99 - really good

# Working On
* Leveling up my life management skills (still). My platform at work has gotten super popular so we're dealing with a lot of growth issues.
