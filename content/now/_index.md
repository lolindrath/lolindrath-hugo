# Currently Reading
* The Calculating Stars - really good book so far
* Radical Candor - Kim Malone Scott - man do I need to finish this... yet again
* Washington: A Life - Ron Chernow - after reading Hamilton I picked this up, it is a very detailed account of his whole life with really interesting insights into how he created himself.

(been hitting Libby hard for audiobooks lately)

## Just Finished
* The Talent Code
* Hillbilly Elegy
* Barsk: The Elephant Graveyard - really good book
* It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work - Jason Fried - Definitely made me think about how to implement some of the calm company stuff in a big corporation


## Soon
* Station Eleven


# Watching
* Battlestar Galactica - halfway through season 3

# Working On
* Leveling up my life management skills
