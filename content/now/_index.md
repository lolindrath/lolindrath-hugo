# Currently Reading
* Radical Candor - Kim Malone Scott - Having trouble making my way through this book but it really is good.
* Clean Coders - Robert C. Martin - On going work thing, Saying No and Saying Yes were interesting chapters
* Principles - Ray Dalio - listening to this book, it's good but dense so I can't listen long before I have to digest.
* The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter - Theodora Goss - I heard about this on the review of Nebula nominees that the Incomparable Podcast did and thought it would be a fun read.

# Listening To
* [Focus3 Podcast](https://www.focus3.com/podcast) - re-listening to a bunch and taking notes now
* [Cortex Podcast](https://relay.fm/cortex) - Relay had a CMS error that pushed a bunch of old Cortexes to my phone so now I'm relistening to these too. They're all gold.

# Watching
* Babylon 5 - man does it start off slow and awkward. I'm going to give it a few episodes though
* Parks and Rec - I completely missed just how good this show was, I have to slow myself down on this series.

# Working On
* Being a better leader and manager.
* Being a father to two kids
* Making more progress on Goals and not so much the Whirlwind
