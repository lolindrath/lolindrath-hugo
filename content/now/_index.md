# Currently Reading
* Radical Candor - Kim Malone Scott - Having trouble making my way through this book but it really is good.
* Control of Nature - John McPhee - Great book with excellent writing on an interesting topic. The tenuous control we have over nature itself
* Washington: A Life - Ron Chernow - after reading Hamilton I picked this up, it is a very detailed account of his whole life with really interesting insights into how he created himself.

## Just Finished
* Clean Coders - Robert C. Martin - I finished reading it but we're still working through it at our lunch and learn.


# Listening To
* Backing off podcasts worked pretty well. Way less news and more deeper interviews.

# Watching
* Babylon 5 - Season 4 is a big big payoff.
* Parks and Rec - Still holding back, ready to start again soon.
* The Office - my 7 month old daughter likes to fall asleep watching it.

# Working On
* Being a better leader and manager.
* Being a father to two kids
* Making more progress on Goals and not so much the Whirlwind
