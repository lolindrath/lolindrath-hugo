# Currently Reading
* High Output Management - Andy Grove - management book written by the Intel dude. I've seen this recommended strongly on a lot of podcasts by a lot of cool people.
* The Calculating Stars - really good book so far
* Radical Candor - Kim Malone Scott - man do I need to finish this... yet again
* Washington: A Life - Ron Chernow - after reading Hamilton I picked this up, it is a very detailed account of his whole life with really interesting insights into how he created himself.

(still working on all of these, been listening to a lot of audiobooks)

## Just Finished
* The Graveyard Book - Neil Gaiman
* Stardust - Neil Gaiman
* Rogue Protocol - Martha Wells
* The Ocean at the End of the Lane - Neil Gaiman
* Odd and the Frost Giants - Neil Gaiman

(Been hitting Libby hard for Neil Gaiman - love these books. Murderbot Diaries series is also great)

## Soon
