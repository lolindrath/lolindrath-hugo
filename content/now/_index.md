# Currently Reading
* Radical Candor - Kim Malone Scott - man do I need to finish this... yet again
* Washington: A Life - Ron Chernow - after reading Hamilton I picked this up, it is a very detailed account of his whole life with really interesting insights into how he created himself.


## Didn't Finish
* The Effective Executive - Drucker - Couldn't do it, I listened to [Cortex](https://relay.fm/cortex) talk about it so close enough

## Just Finished
* The Blade Itself - Joe Ambercrombie - sold to me as groundbreaking fantasy series but it seems pretty bog standard
* Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - re-listened to this, so good
* Breakfast of Champions - I forgot how weird this book was
* Island by Aldous Huxley - I heard this was a counter to his Brave New World, decent book but nothing groundbreaking



## Soon
* It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work - Jason Fried - this looked like an interesting one, how practical it is at a big 


# Watched
* Babylon 5 - Amazing series, very glad I went and watched it plus listened to [B5 Audio Guide](http://b5audioguide.com/?cat=7)
* Netflix Marvel series - watching way too many of these. Finished The Punisher Season 1, Luke Cage Season 2 and working on Dare Devil now

# Working On
* Being 37
