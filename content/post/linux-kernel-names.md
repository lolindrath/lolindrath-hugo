Instagram served me a Reel the other day of Linux Torvalds talking about
how every Linux kernel had a name in the Makefile. There's some pretty good ones
but I think my favorite is `Linux for Workgroups`.

Here's my quick and dirty script to spit them out:

```bash
for tag in $(git tag)
do
	echo Checking out ${tag}...
	git checkout --quiet $tag
	name=$(grep NAME Makefile)
	echo ${tag},${name}
	git clean -f --quiet
	git reset --quiet --hard HEAD
	git clean -fd --quiet
done
```
