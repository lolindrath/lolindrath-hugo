**Update 2020-08-17**: I got a new Apple Watch so I updated the wallpapers in this article to the new size. It should look much better on the new models.

I've been consuming a lot of podcasts and media by the [Focus 3 team](http://focus3.com), [Tim Kight](https://twitter.com/timothykight) and [Brian Kight](https://twitter.com/tbriankight) and I made some Apple Watch wallpapers to remind me of key points in their system.

The goal is to become the best version of you. To know what you want and achieve and the discipline required to do it.

Here's a short explanation of each of the wallpapers included:

- _Doesn't Matter, Get Better_ - Did you win? Doesn't matter, get better. Did you lose? Doesn't matter, get better.
- _No BCD_ - Blaming complaining and defending are a waste of time, stop doing them and Do the Work.
- _Do The Work_ - Figure out what work is required and do it. Stop planning, re-planning and procrastinating.
- _E+R=O_ - You can't control the event but you can control your response which influences the outcome. 
- _Disciple over Default_ - There is only Discipline, avoid your default response (e.x. I'm tired, I'll just watch some Netflix) and overcome it with discipline to achieve the life you want.

Here's a video to get you started:
