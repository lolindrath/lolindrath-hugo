# Outline

Don't use Xcode from the AppStore - manage Xcode versions
Great community
Apple docs aren’t great but there's so many awesome people doing fantastic work to provide them
Working at a big company doesn’t mean you know how to write and ship an app - custom frameworks and niches
WWDC and when you might actually get to work with that tech - leave comments, write your notes and when you can revisit them
