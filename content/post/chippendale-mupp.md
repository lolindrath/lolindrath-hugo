I've been reading [Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book](http://seuss.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27s_Sleep_Book) many, many times with my son[^1]. I get stuck on the continuity and engineering/science questions in these books, here's one...


# How Long is a Chippendale Mupp Tail?


If you don't know, the above creature is called a Chippendale Mupp[^2]. He falls asleep each night after biting his tail which acts as its alarm. Its tail is so long that he apparently gets a full nights sleep before the pain wakes him up.


Pain impulses move at around 2 ft/s [^3] and it's safe to say a Chippendale Mupp needs around 8 hours of sleep[^4] and so:

8 hours in seconds = 28,800 seconds


28,800 seconds / 2 ft/s = 14,400 ft


14,400 ft to miles = 2.7 miles


So, for a Chippendale Mupp to get his 8 hours of snooze he has to have a _2.7-mile_ long tail.



[^1]: He seems to get stuck on a book for a week or more where he carries it all over the house and wants to read it at naptime and bedtime every day.
